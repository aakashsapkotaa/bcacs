Module 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing

Semester End Examination Prep

Question 1

1a. Define Cloud Computing? Explain its working mechanism with a diagram. (08 Marks)

Definition: Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—like servers, storage,
databases, and software—over the Internet ("the cloud"). Instead of buying and maintaining
physical data centers, you rent access to these services from a provider (like AWS or Google
Cloud) on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Formal Definition (NIST - Simplified): It is a model that allows convenient, on-demand
network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (like networks, servers,
and storage) that can be set up quickly with minimal effort.

Working Mechanism: Cloud computing works by connecting a user's device to the provider's
data centers via the internet. It is divided into two main sections:

1. Frontend (Client Side): This is the side the user sees. It includes the user's computer,
network, and the application used to access the cloud (like a web browser).

2. Backend (Server Side): This is the "cloud" itself. It consists of servers, data storage
systems, and the software that runs the services.

3. The Internet: This acts as the bridge connecting the Frontend to the Backend.

4. Central Server: This manages the traffic and ensures everything runs smoothly by
following specific rules (protocols).

Diagram: (in your exam, draw a simple diagram like this)

1b. Explain the Goals of cloud computing and alignment with IT needs. (06 Marks)

The main goal of cloud computing is to make IT resources more efficient and accessible. The

five key goals (characteristics) are:
1. On-Demand Self-Service:

* Users can get computing power (like server time or network storage) automatically
whenever they need it, without needing to talk to a human admin.

2. Broad Network Access:

e Services are available over the network and can be accessed through standard
devices like mobile phones, laptops, and tablets from anywhere.

3. Resource Pooling:

e The provider's resources serve multiple customers at the same time (Multi-tenancy).
Physical and virtual resources are assigned and reassigned according to demand.

4. Rapid Elasticity:

* Capabilities can scale outward (get bigger) and inward (get smaller) quickly. To the
user, the resources often look unlimited and can be bought in any quantity at any time.

5. Measured Service:

¢ Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use. Usage is monitored
and billed, so you only pay for what you actually use (like an electricity bill).

1c. Explain how organizations can leverage cloud computing to improve business agility
and scalability. (06 Marks)

Organizations use cloud computing to gain a competitive advantage in the following ways:

1. Improving Agility (Speed):

e Faster Deployment: In a traditional setup, getting a new server might take weeks. In the
cloud, developers can deploy resources in minutes.

¢ Time-to-Market: Because infrastructure is ready instantly, businesses can launch new

products and updates much faster.

e Innovation: It allows companies to experiment with new technologies (like Al or Big Data)
without a huge risk or upfront cost.
2. Improving Scalability:
e Global Scale: You can deploy your application in multiple physical locations around the

world with just a few clicks, putting your app closer to your customers.

e Elasticity: If your website suddenly gets a million visitors (traffic spike), the cloud
automatically adds more resources to handle it. When traffic drops, it reduces the

resources to save money.
Question 2

2a. What is cloud computing and benefits of cloud computing? (07 Marks)

What is Cloud Computing? (Refer to the definition in Answer 1a). It is accessing computing
resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis rather than owning physical hardware.
Benefits of Cloud Computing:

1. Cost Savings: You trade Capital Expense (fixed costs like buying servers) for Variable
Expense (paying only for what you use).

2. Agility & Speed: massive amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes,
giving businesses a lot of flexibility.

3. Global Scale: You can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes.

4. Productivity: It removes the need for “racking and stacking"—physical chores like setting
up hardware, software patching, and cabling. IT teams can focus on important business
goals instead.

5. Reliability: Cloud providers offer data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity,
which makes data safer and easier to recover.

2b. Explain the concept of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) in cloud computing with
suitable examples. (07 Marks)

Concept of TCO: Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is a financial estimate used to determine the
direct and indirect costs of a product or system. In the cloud, TCO analysis helps a company
decide if moving to the cloud is cheaper than staying on-premises (in their own building).

Key Shift: CapEx vs. OpEx

¢ CapEx (Capital Expenditure): Money spent upfront on physical infrastructure (buying
servers, ACs, building data centers). This is the traditional model.

e OpEx (Operational Expenditure): Money spent on services as they are used (monthly
subscriptions). This is the Cloud model.

TCO Calculation Factors (Examples): To calculate TCO, you must compare costs across

several areas:
1. Server Costs: Buying hardware (Traditional) vs. Renting instances (Cloud).

2. Storage Costs: Buying hard drives/tape drives (Traditional) vs. Paying per GB of cloud
storage (Cloud).

3. Facility Costs: Paying for real estate, power, and cooling (Traditional) vs. $0 facility costs
(Cloud).

4. Labor Costs: Salaries for staff to repair hardware (Traditional) vs. Staff focusing on
strategy (Cloud).

Example: If a company buys a server for $10,000 (CapEx), they pay for it whether they use it or
not. If they move to the cloud, they might pay $0.50 per hour (OpEx). If they only need the
server for 10 hours, the cloud cost is $5.00 vs $10,000 upfront.

2c. Discuss in detail the major deployment models for cloud computing. (06 Marks)

The deployment model determines where the hardware lives and who manages it. There are

three major models:

1. Public Cloud:

Definition: The infrastructure is owned and managed by a third-party provider (like AWS or
Azure) and is available to the general public over the internet.

Characteristics: Resources are shared among many organizations (Multi-tenancy). It has
low upfront costs.

Best For: Startups, testing, and websites with fluctuating traffic.

2. Private Cloud:

Definition: The infrastructure is used exclusively by a single organization. It can be located
on-site or hosted by a third-party, but it is not shared with others.

Characteristics: It offers the highest level of security and control. It is more expensive due

to hardware and maintenance costs.

Best For: Banks, government agencies, and companies with strict data privacy rules.

3. Hybrid Cloud:

Definition: A combination of Public and Private clouds. They remain unique entities but are
connected by technology that allows data and applications to move between them.

Characteristics: It offers flexibility. You can keep sensitive data in the private cloud and
use the public cloud for extra power during peak times (Cloud Bursting).

Best For: Organizations that need to balance security regulations with the flexibility of the

public cloud.

Question 3

3a. Explain the SaaS model. What are the advantages and disadvantages of SaaS?
Illustrate with real-world applications. (10 Marks)

SaaS (Software as a Service) Model: SaaS is a software distribution model where a third-

party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet.

How it works: You don't install software on your computer (like a CD-ROM). Instead, you

access it via a web browser.

Management: The user manages nothing. The provider manages everything: the network,
servers, operating systems, storage, and application updates.

Advantages:

1.
2.

4.

Lower Upfront Cost: You don't need to buy expensive software licenses or servers.

Accessibility: You can access the software from anywhere (home, office, coffee shop) as
long as you have the internet.

Automatic Updates: The provider handles all patches and upgrades. You always have the
latest version.

Scalability: You can easily add more users (licenses) as your company grows.

Disadvantages:

1.

Security Risks: Your data is stored on someone else's server, which raises privacy

concerns.
Vendor Lock-in: It can be difficult to switch to a different provider or move your data out.
Internet Dependence: If your internet goes down, you cannot work.

Limited Customization: It is a "one-size-fits-all" solution. You often cannot change the
software to fit your specific business needs perfectly.

Real-World Applications (Examples):

Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs): For email and document creation.
Salesforce: For managing customer relationships (CRM).
Dropbox: For file storage.

Microsoft Office 365: For productivity tools (Word, Excel online).

3b. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of SaaS, laaS, and PaaS with real-world
examples from industry usage. (10 Marks)

4a. Explain the laaS model and components in detail with examples. (05 Marks)

laaS (Infrastructure as a Service) Model: laaS provides virtualized computing resources over

the internet. It is like renting the raw hardware (servers) rather than buying it.

e Control: The user has the highest level of control. The provider manages the physical

hardware, but the user manages the Operating System (OS), middleware, and applications.

Key Components:

1. Virtual Machines (VMs): The main computing unit (like a virtual CPU and RAM).

2. Storage: Places to store data, either as "Block storage” (like a hard drive) or “Object

storage" (for files).

3. Network: Virtual networks (VLANs), IP addresses, and firewalls to connect the VMs.

4. Load Balancers: Tools to distribute traffic across multiple servers.

Example:
e Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): A user rents a virtual Linux server, installs their
own database software on it, and manages the security settings themselves.

Ab. Define virtualization and explain its key characteristics in detail. (O05 Marks)
Definition: Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based (virtual) representation of
something, such as a server, storage device, or network. It allows a single physical computer to
run multiple "Virtual Machines" (VMs) at the same time.
Key Characteristics:

1. Partitioning: You can split one physical server into many smaller, safe virtual servers.

2. Isolation: If one VM crashes or gets a virus, the others are safe. They do not affect each
other.

3. Encapsulation: A complete VM (OS + Apps + Data) is saved as a single file. This makes it
easy to move or copy.

4. Hardware Independence: A VM can run on any physical server. It doesn't care what brand

of hardware is underneath.

4c. Compare cold, warm, and live VM migration in cloud computing. (05 Marks)
VM Migration is moving a Virtual Machine from one physical server to another.
1. Cold Migration:

¢ Process: The VM is powered off. The files are moved to the new server, and then the

VM is turned back on.
¢ Impact: There is significant downtime (the service stops working during the move).
¢ Use Case: Maintenance windows where downtime is allowed.
2. Warm Migration (Suspend/Resume):

¢ Process: The VM is suspended (paused). The state (memory) is saved to disk, moved,
and then resumed on the new server.

¢ Impact: Short downtime (seconds to minutes), but open network connections might
drop.

3. Live Migration:

¢ Process: The VM moves while it is still running. The memory is copied page-by-page
while the user is still using the app.

¢ Impact: Zero downtime. The user doesn't even notice the move happened.

e Use Case: Load balancing or critical server maintenance.

4d. What is a Multi-Cloud Model? Explain in detail. (05 Marks)

Definition: A Multi-Cloud model is a strategy where an organization uses cloud services from
two or more different public cloud providers (e.g., using both AWS and Google Cloud) at the

same time.
Why use it? (Details):

1. Avoid Vendor Lock-in: If one provider raises prices or has technical issues, you are not
stuck with them because you have another provider ready.

2. Best-of-Breed Services: You might use Google Cloud for its excellent Al tools, but use
Microsoft Azure because it works well with your Office 365. You pick the best tool from
each provider.

3. Reliability (Redundancy): If AWS goes down in a specific region, your application can
keep running on Azure.

4. Compliance: Some data might need to be stored in specific countries. Using different
providers helps meet these local laws.

Question 5

5a. Define Parallel Computing? Write the differences between parallel computing and
distributed computing. (08 Marks)

Definition: Parallel Computing is the process of using multiple processing elements (CPUs or
Cores) simultaneously to solve a single problem.

¢ How it works: A large problem is broken down into smaller parts. These parts are
processed at the exact same time by different processors within a single computer system.

¢ Goal: To solve problems faster (Speedup).

Differences between Parallel and Distributed Computing:

Feature Parallel Computing Distributed Computing

Architecture Multiple processors within one Multiple autonomous computers connected
single computer (Tightly Coupled). —_— via a network (Loosely Coupled).

Memory Processors usually share the same Each computer has its own private

memory (RAM). memory. They cannot see each other's RAM
directly.

Communication Communication happens via the Communication happens via the
system bus (very fast). network/internet (slower, message passing).

Goal Performance (Speed). Resource Sharing and Scalability.

Example A Supercomputer or a Multicore The World Wide Web (Internet) or a Cloud
Laptop. Data Center.

5b. Explain Aneka in Cloud Computing. (06 Marks)

Overview: Aneka is a cloud application platform designed specifically for the .NET
environment (Windows). While most cloud tools are Linux-based, Aneka allows developers to
build clouds using Microsoft technologies.

Key Features:

1. PaaS Solution: It provides a runtime environment for developing and deploying
applications.

2. Flexible Programming Models: Unlike other platforms that might only support one
method, Aneka supports multiple ways to write code:
¢ Task Programming: For independent tasks.
¢ Thread Programming: For applications that use threads.
¢ MapReduce: For data-intensive processing.

3. Enterprise Use: It is often used to build private or enterprise clouds where companies
want to utilize their idle desktop computers to create a “desktop grid."

5c. Write Short note on AWS. (06 Marks)

AWS (Amazon Web Services): AWS is the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted
cloud platform. It primarily offers Infrastructure as a Service (laaS) but also provides PaaS
and Saa$& tools.

Key Components:

1. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): This is the core service. It allows users to rent virtual
machines (instances). You can choose the OS (Windows/Linux) and power (CPU/RAM) you
need.

2. $3 (Simple Storage Service): A service for storing files (objects). It offers unlimited
storage that is highly durable (data doesn't get lost).

3. SDKs (Software Development Kits): AWS provides tools for almost every programming
language (Java, Python, .NET) so developers can control the cloud using code instead of

just clicking buttons on a website.

Question 6 (OR Option)

6a. What is Hadoop? Explain its architecture and components in detail. (10 Marks)
Definition: Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework used for storing and
processing massive datasets (Big Data). It is based on the MapReduce programming model.
Hadoop Architecture: Hadoop follows a Master-Slave Architecture.

¢ Master Node: The "Boss." It manages the file system namespace and schedules jobs.

e Slave Nodes: The "Workers." They do the actual work of storing data and running
computations.

Key Components:
1. HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System):
¢ Function: This is the storage layer.

¢ How it works: When you save a large file, HDFS chops it into smaller "blocks." These
blocks are distributed across many different machines.

¢ Fault Tolerance: It makes copies (replicas) of every block. If one server crashes, the

data is safe on another server.
2. MapReduce:

¢ Function: This is the processing layer.
e Logie: It processes data in two steps:
e Map: Breaks the task into smaller sub-tasks.
e Reduce: Collects the results and combines them into a final answer.
3. YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator):
e Function: This is the resource management layer.

* Role: It acts like an operating system for the cluster. It allocates CPU and RAM to
different applications running on the system.

6b. What is Google App Engine? Explain its features and advantages in detail. (10 Marks)
Definition: Google App Engine (GAE) is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) product offered by

Google. It allows developers to build and host web applications on Google's own infrastructure.

Core Concept: The developer focuses only on writing code. Google handles the servers,
operating systems, and scaling.
Key Features:

1. Automatic Scaling: If your app goes from 10 users to 10 million users overnight, GAE
automatically adds more resources to handle it. You don't have to touch anything.

2. Datastore: It uses a NoSQL database that is highly scalable, rather than a traditional SQL
database.

3. Language Support: It supports popular languages like Python, Java, Go, and PHP.
Advantages:

1. Zero Maintenance: You never have to patch a server or configure a firewall. Google does it
all.

2. Pay-as-you-go: You only pay for the resources your app actually uses. If no one visits
your site, the cost is near zero.

3. High Reliability: Your app runs in Google's data centers (the same ones that run YouTube
and Search), so it is very unlikely to go down.

Question 7

7a. Define a hypervisor. Explain how Type-1 and Type-2 hypervisors differ in design and
usage. (10 Marks)

Definition: A Hypervisor (or Virtual Machine Monitor - VMM) is the software that creates and
runs Virtual Machines (VMs). It sits between the physical hardware and the virtual machines,
managing resources like CPU, RAM, and Storage so multiple operating systems can run on one
computer at the same time.

Differences between Type-1 and Type-2 Hypervisors:

Feature Type-1 (Bare-Metal / Native) Type-2 (Hosted)

Design Installs directly on the physical Installs as a software application on top of
hardware. It replaces the Host an existing OS (like Windows or Linux).
Operating System.

Performance High Performance. It talks directly to Lower Performance. Requests must pass
the hardware without a "middleman." through the Host OS first, which slows

things down.

Usage Used in Enterprise Data Centers and Used on Personal Computers for testing,
Cloud Providers (AWS, Google Cloud). learning, or labs.

Examples VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen. Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation.

7b. What is a virtual cluster? Explain how virtual clusters support distributed cloud
workloads. (05 Marks)

Definition: A Virtual Cluster is a group of Virtual Machines (VMs) connected together to work
as a single, powerful system (like a Supercomputer). These VMs can be located on the same
physical server or spread across different physical servers, but they act as one unit.

How they support distributed workloads:

1. High Availability: If one VM in the cluster fails, the others automatically take over the
work. This ensures the application never goes down.

2. Load Balancing: The cluster distributes the workload evenly across all VMs. If a complex
task (like processing big data) comes in, the cluster splits the job so it finishes faster.

3. Dynamic Sealing: You can add more VMs to the cluster instantly when the workload
increases, without buying new physical hardware.
7c. Define data center automation. Describe how virtualization enables automated
provisioning and scaling. (05 Marks)

Definition: Data Center Automation is the use of software and scripts to perform IT tasks—
like installing servers, configuring networks, and patching software—without human
intervention.

How Virtualization enables this:

1. Automated Provisioning (Creation): Since a Virtual Machine is just a software file,
automation tools can "copy and paste" it. A script can create 100 new servers in minutes,
whereas a human would take weeks to plug in 100 physical servers.

2. Automated Scaling: Virtualization allows software to change hardware specs instantly. If a
server is slow, an automated script can increase its RAM or CPU allocation on the fly
without turning off the machine.

Question 8 (OR Option)

8a. What is virtualization? Describe in detail the architecture used to virtualize CPU,
memory, and I/O devices within a cloud computing environment. (10 Marks)

Definition: Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based (virtual) representation of
a physical resource, such as a server, storage device, or network. It allows one physical
computer to run multiple isolated operating systems (VMs) simultaneously.

Virtualization Architecture: The architecture relies on the Hypervisor to trick the Guest OS
into thinking it has real hardware.
1. CPU Virtualization:
e The Hypervisor schedules “time slots" on the physical CPU.

e |t intercepts instructions from the Guest OS. If a VM asks to process data, the
hypervisor passes it to the real CPU, gets the result, and hands it back to the VM. The
VM believes it has its own dedicated processor.

2. Memory Virtualization:
* The Hypervisor manages a map called "Page Tables.”

e It maps the Virtual Memory (what the Guest OS sees) to the Physical Memory (real
RAM). It ensures that VM A cannot read the memory addresses assigned to VM B,

keeping them secure and isolated.
3. I/O Virtualization (Input/Output):
e This handles devices like Hard Drives and Network Cards.

e The Hypervisor creates "Virtual Drivers." When a VM tries to save a file, the hypervisor
takes that request and sends it to the real hard drive. It acts like a traffic cop,
managing data flow for multiple VMs sharing the same network cable.
8b. Describe the various implementation levels of virtualization with suitable examples
for each level. (05 Marks)

Virtualization can be implemented at different layers of a computer system:
1. Hardware Level (Server Virtualization):

¢ Virtualization happens directly on the hardware using a Hypervisor. This creates full
Virtual Machines.

¢ Example: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V.
2. Operating System Level (Containerization):

e The Host OS kernel is shared. Instead of creating full VMs, it creates lightweight
isolated spaces called "Containers."

e Example: Docker, Kubernetes.
3. Application Level:

e Virtualization happens inside a specific application environment. The app runs ona
"Virtual Machine" created by the programming language, not the OS.

e Example: Java Virtual Machine (JVM) runs Java code on any computer.

8c. Explain any four virtualization tools used in cloud computing. Mention one key feature
of each tool. (O05 Marks)

1. VMware vSphere (ESXi):
e Type: Type-1 Hypervisor.

¢ Key Feature: High Stability & Reliability. It is the industry standard for large
enterprise data centers.

2. Oracle VirtualBox:
* Type: Type-2 Hypervisor.

* Key Feature: Free & Open Source. It is excellent for students and developers testing
software on their personal laptops.

3. Docker:
e Type: Container Engine.

e Key Feature: Lightweight. It starts up in milliseconds because it doesn't need to load a
full Operating System for every app.

4. Microsoft Hyper-V:
e Type: Type-1 Hypervisor.

e Key Feature: Windows Integration. It comes built-in with Windows Server and
Windows 10/11 Pro, making it easy for Windows users to adopt.

Semester End Examination Preparation

Question 9

9a. What is security management in Peer-to-Peer networks? Explain why P2P systems
require decentralized protection mechanisms. (08 Marks)

Security Management in P2P: In a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network, there is no central server.
Every computer (node) acts as both a client and a server. Security management involves
securing these direct connections to prevent the spread of bad data or viruses.

Why they require decentralized protection:

1. No Central Authority: Unlike a bank or a standard website, there is no "Main Server" to

ban bad users or verify identities. Everyone is equal.

2. Anonymous Users: Users can join the network anonymously. This makes it easy for
attackers to hide.

3. Dynamic Network: Nodes join and leave instantly. A centralized firewall cannot protect a
network that changes every second.

4. Scalability: If millions of users had to check with one central security server, the system
would crash. The security must be spread out (decentralized) across all nodes.

9b. Define cloud security. Explain why trust management is essential in multi-tenant
cloud environments. (06 Marks)

Cloud Security: Cloud security is a set of policies, controls, and technologies used to protect
data, applications, and infrastructure involved in cloud computing. It focuses on keeping data
private (Confidentiality), safe from changes (Integrity), and accessible (Availability).

Why Trust Management is essential: In a multi-tenant environment, different companies
(tenants) store their data on the same physical server.

1. Lack of Physical Control: You cannot see or touch the server holding your data. You must
"trust" the provider is keeping it safe.

2. No Peeking: Trust management ensures that Tenant A cannot see Tenant B's data, even
though they share the same hard drive.

3. Accountability: If data is lost or stolen, trust management frameworks (like SLAs) define
who is responsible—the customer or the provider.

9c. What is distributed intrusion detection? Explain how multiple agents cooperate to
detect attacks in cloud systems. (06 Marks)
Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS): A standard Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
watches one computer for hackers. A Distributed IDS watches the entire cloud. It consists of
sensors placed on many different servers that talk to each other.

How agents cooperate:

1. Local Agents: Small software programs (agents) sit on every server in the cloud. They
monitor local traffic for suspicious activity (like a virus or a hacker scanning ports).

2. Central Analysis: These agents send their logs to a central brain (Analysis Engine).

3. Collective Immunity: If an agent on Server A sees a new attack, it tells the central brain.
The brain then instantly updates Server B, C, and D to block that attack. The whole cloud

learns from one attack.

Question 10 (OR Option)

10a. What is Power Trust? Describe how it improves reputation accuracy in large-scale
P2P systems. (10 Marks)

PowerTrust: PowerTrust is a reputation management system designed for P2P networks. It is
built to separate the "good" reliable nodes from the "bad" malicious nodes effectively.

How it improves accuracy: It uses the concept of "Power Nodes" based on the Power-Law
Distribution (the 80/20 rule).

1. Identifying Power Nodes: In any network, a small number of users (Power Nodes) are very
active and honest. They do most of the good work.

2. Aggregation: Instead of asking random strangers if a user is trustworthy, the system asks
these highly reputable Power Nodes.

3. Speed & Accuracy: Because Power Nodes have more history and data, their feedback is
more accurate. Relying on them makes calculating trust scores faster and reduces the
chance of fake reviews.

10b. What is data encryption? Mention one reason it is essential in cloud storage. (05
Marks)

Data Encryption: Encryption is the process of scrambling data into a code (ciphertext) so that
it looks like gibberish to anyone who does not have the "key" (password) to read it.

Why it is essential in Cloud Storage:

¢ Privacy from the Provider: Even if the cloud provider (like Google or Amazon) has access
to the physical hard drive, they cannot read your files if they are encrypted. It ensures only
you know what is in your data.

10c. What is virtualization security? Give one threat related to hypervisors. (05 Marks)

Virtualization Security: This refers to the security measures taken to protect the Virtual
Machines (VMs) and the Hypervisor software that manages them. It ensures that the software
layer separating the VMs remains strong.

One Threat: VM Escape

¢ Description: "VM Escape" is an attack where a hacker crashes out of the Virtual Machine
they are renting and gains access to the underlying Host Server (Hypervisor).

¢ Danger: If they "escape," they can potentially control or spy on ail other Virtual Machines
