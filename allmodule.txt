# 📘 MODULE – II

## Cryptography & Data Security Concepts

---

## **Q3 (a) Explain the concepts of Confusion and Diffusion in cryptography with suitable examples** (4 Marks)

### **Answer:**

In cryptography, **Confusion** and **Diffusion** are two important principles introduced by **Claude Shannon** to make encryption strong.

---

### 🔹 **1. Confusion**

**Definition:**
Confusion hides the **relationship between the key and the ciphertext**.

* Makes it difficult for attackers to guess the key
* Achieved using **substitution techniques**

👉 **Example:**
Replacing letters using a substitution cipher
A → X, B → M, C → Q

Even if attacker sees ciphertext, they **cannot understand the key**.

📌 *Real-life example:*
ATM PIN → numbers shown as ****

---

### 🔹 **2. Diffusion**

**Definition:**
Diffusion spreads the **influence of one plaintext character over many ciphertext characters**.

* Small change in plaintext → large change in ciphertext
* Achieved using **transposition and permutation**

👉 **Example:**
Changing one letter in password changes the whole encrypted output.

📌 *Real-life example:*
Changing one letter in WhatsApp message changes entire encrypted data.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion:**

Confusion hides the key relation, diffusion spreads data changes—both together make encryption secure.

---

## **Q3 (b) Compare Symmetric key and Asymmetric key cryptography in detail with suitable example** (10 Marks)

### **Answer:**

Cryptography is classified into **Symmetric Key** and **Asymmetric Key** cryptography.

---

### 🔹 **Symmetric Key Cryptography**

**Definition:**
Uses **one single key** for both encryption and decryption.

**Features:**

* Fast
* Less computational power
* Key distribution problem

**Examples:**

* DES
* AES

📌 *Real-life example:*
Door lock – same key to lock and unlock.

---

### 🔹 **Asymmetric Key Cryptography**

**Definition:**
Uses **two different keys**:

* Public Key (shared)
* Private Key (secret)

**Features:**

* More secure
* Slower than symmetric
* No key distribution problem

**Examples:**

* RSA
* ECC

📌 *Real-life example:*
Email system – anyone can send mail (public key), only receiver can read (private key).

---

### 🔸 **Comparison Table**

| Feature     | Symmetric Key | Asymmetric Key |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Keys used   | One key       | Two keys       |
| Speed       | Fast          | Slow           |
| Security    | Less secure   | More secure    |
| Key sharing | Required      | Not required   |
| Example     | AES           | RSA            |
